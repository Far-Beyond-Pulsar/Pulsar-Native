# ⭐ Support the Project

If Pulsar Engine aligns with how you think game engines should be built, consider supporting the project on GitHub:
- ⭐ Star the repo to help others discover Pulsar
- 👀 Watch for updates to follow major architectural changes and milestones
- 🍴 Fork if you want to experiment or contribute
Stars and watches directly influence visibility and help justify continued deep-systems work on the engine.

## About Pulsar

Pulsar Engine is an early-stage game engine built by developers who felt game engines deserved to be better from front to back.

The focus is on questioning assumptions that have calcified in existing engines and rebuilding core systems and UI experiences with clarity and intent. Pulsar emphasizes:

* Scalable world simulation and spatial partitioning
* Modern, Rust-first tooling and workflows
* Explicit and modular engine architecture
* Long-term maintainability over short-term convenience
* In-editor stability as a first priority

## 🚧 Platform Support Notice

### Temporary Loss of Support for Non‑Windows Platforms

Non‑Windows support is temporarily limited while core architectural changes are underway.

📌 **Tracking discussion:**
[https://github.com/orgs/Far-Beyond-Pulsar/discussions/17](https://github.com/orgs/Far-Beyond-Pulsar/discussions/17)

We are actively working toward restoring cross‑platform compatibility.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Pulsar automatically manages dependencies and setup where possible.

```bash
cargo run --release
```

If required dependencies are missing, the engine will guide you through installation before you can enter the launcher.
