## About Pulsar

Pulsar Engine is an early-stage game engine built by developers who felt game engines deserved to be better from front to back.

The focus is on questioning assumptions that have calcified in existing engines and rebuilding core systems and UI experiences with clarity and intent. Pulsar emphasizes:

* Scalable world simulation and spatial partitioning
* Modern, Rust-first tooling and workflows
* Explicit and modular engine architecture
* Long-term maintainability over short-term convenience
* In-editor stability as a first priority
