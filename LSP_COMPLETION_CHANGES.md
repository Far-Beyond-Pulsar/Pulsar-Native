# LSP Completion System - Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. lsp_completion_provider.rs
**File**: `crates/engine/src/ui/lsp_completion_provider.rs`

#### Changes:
- Added debug logging to track completion requests and responses
- Improved trigger character detection:
  - Alphanumeric + underscore → Always trigger
  - `.`, `:`, `<` → LSP registered triggers  
  - Space → For keyword completions
  - `(`, `,`, `[` → For function/array contexts
- Added logging for empty/null responses to debug issues

#### Key Points:
- ✅ No file sync in completion handler (prevents "unexpected DidChangeTextDocument" errors)
- ✅ Fully async - spawns task immediately
- ✅ No blocking operations on main thread
- ✅ Proper error handling

### 2. completion_menu.rs  
**File**: `crates/ui/src/input/popovers/completion_menu.rs`

#### Already Fixed (in recent commits):
- ✅ Removed `update_filter()` function (no client-side filtering)
- ✅ `set_query()` no longer filters - just stores for display
- ✅ `set_items()` sorts by `sortText` (respects LSP priority)
- ✅ Added icons based on `CompletionItemKind`
- ✅ Added `[LSP]` source label
- ✅ Shows `detail` field for type/path information

### 3. completions.rs
**File**: `crates/ui/src/input/lsp/completions.rs`

#### Already Fixed (in recent commits):
- ✅ Requests new completions on every trigger
- ✅ Shows loading state immediately (non-blocking UI)
- ✅ Async task for LSP request
- ✅ No client-side filtering
- ✅ Displays results exactly as received from server

## Remaining Issues to Investigate

### 1. "unexpected DidChangeTextDocument" Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
[rust-analyzer stderr] ERROR unexpected DidChangeTextDocument path=...
```

**Possible Causes:**
- File not opened with `didOpen` before `didChange`
- Multiple `didChange` calls for same version
- Race condition between `didOpen` and `didChange`

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check TextEditor subscription order
- Verify `didOpen` is called before first `didChange`
- Ensure version numbers increment correctly

### 2. No Completions for `std::`

**Symptoms:**
- Typing `std::` returns no completions
- Works in VSCode but not in our editor

**Possible Causes:**
- File content not synced before completion request
- Wrong file URI format
- rust-analyzer not finished indexing
- Workspace root not set correctly

**Investigation Needed:**
- Add logging to verify file content at completion time
- Check LSP file URI format (should be `file:///C:/...`)
- Verify workspace root matches Cargo.toml location
- Check rust-analyzer indexing status

### 3. Sluggish Completions

**Symptoms:**
- UI freezes briefly when typing
- Delay before completions appear

**Possible Causes:**
- Blocking on rope-to-string conversion
- Blocking on LSP request
- Too many sync file updates

**Already Fixed:**
- ✅ Async task spawning
- ✅ Rope clone instead of convert
- ✅ Loading state shown immediately

**May Need:**
- Debouncing rapid keystrokes
- Cancel in-flight requests when new one starts
- Cache recent completions

### 4. Private Items in Suggestions

**Symptoms:**
- Completions include private items from other modules

**Note:**
- This is rust-analyzer's responsibility
- Server should filter private items
- If appearing, it's likely a rust-analyzer bug or configuration issue

### 5. No Completions After `:`

**Symptoms:**
```
⏭️  Not a trigger character, skipping
```

**Cause:**
- `is_completion_trigger()` might not be catching single `:`

**Solution:**
- The current implementation should trigger on `:` (part of `.`, `:`, `<` check)
- May need to verify the character being checked is correct

## Testing Plan

### Test Cases:

1. **Basic Keyword Completion**
   ```rust
   pub |  // Should show: use, fn, struct, enum, etc.
   ```

2. **Module Path Completion**
   ```rust
   std::|  // Should show: fs, io, collections, etc.
   std::fs::|  // Should show: File, read, write, etc.
   ```

3. **Type Completion**
   ```rust
   let x: |  // Should show types in scope
   Vec<|  // Should show type parameters
   ```

4. **Method Completion**
   ```rust
   let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
   v.|  // Should show: push, pop, len, etc.
   ```

5. **Continuous Typing**
   ```rust
   std::fs::r|  // Should show: read, remove_file, etc.
   std::fs::re|  // Should narrow to: read, remove_*
   std::fs::rea|  // Should narrow to: read, read_*
   ```

6. **Backspace Expansion**
   ```rust
   std::fs::read|  // Shows: read, read_to_string, etc.
   std::fs::rea|  // Should expand to show more
   std::fs::re|  // Should expand further
   ```

7. **Performance**
   ```rust
   // Type rapidly - UI should stay responsive
   // Loading indicator should appear
   // Completions should update smoothly
   ```

### Expected Behavior:

- ✅ No UI freezing
- ✅ Completions appear within 100-200ms
- ✅ Items sorted by relevance (not alphabetically)
- ✅ Icons show correct types
- ✅ `[LSP]` label visible
- ✅ Detail shows paths/types when available
- ✅ No "unexpected DidChangeTextDocument" errors in logs

## Debug Commands

### Enable Verbose Logging:
```rust
// In rust_analyzer_manager.rs
RUST_ANALYZER_LOG=trace

// Check logs for:
- File sync events (didOpen, didChange)
- Completion requests and responses
- Indexing progress
- Errors
```

### Check File URIs:
```rust
// Should be: file:///C:/path/to/file.rs
// NOT: file://C:/path/to/file.rs (missing slash)
// NOT: C:\path\to\file.rs (backslashes, no protocol)
```

### Verify Version Numbers:
```rust
// Should increment on each change
// Check logs for version numbers
// Ensure no duplicates sent to rust-analyzer
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   - Close and restart the engine
   - Try all test cases above
   - Note which ones fail

2. **Fix "unexpected DidChangeTextDocument"**
   - Check subscription setup in TextEditor
   - Verify didOpen called before any didChange
   - Add logging to track call order

3. **Investigate `std::` Issue**
   - Add logging to see what rust-analyzer returns
   - Check file URI format
   - Verify workspace root

4. **Performance Tuning**
   - Add request cancellation for rapid typing
   - Consider debouncing (50-100ms)
   - Profile UI responsiveness

5. **Polish UI**
   - Ensure icons render correctly
   - Verify source labels visible
   - Check detail field formatting
