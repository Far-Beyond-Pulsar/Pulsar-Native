//! # Flow Control Module
//!
//! Flow control and execution routing nodes for the Pulsar visual programming system.
//!
//! This module provides control flow nodes including:
//! - **Branching**: Conditional execution paths (branch, multi_branch)
//! - **Switching**: Value-based routing (switch_on_int, switch_on_bool, switch_on_string, range_switch, string_contains_switch)
//! - **Loops**: Iteration constructs (for_loop, while_loop)
//! - **Sequencing**: Ordered execution (sequence)
//! - **Gating**: Conditional blocking (gate, multi_gate, flip_flop)
//! - **Limiting**: Execution constraints (do_once, do_n)
//! - **Timing**: Delays and timing control (delay, retriggerable_delay)
//!
//! All flow control nodes use `NodeTypes::control_flow` and manage execution flow through
//! execution pins created with the `exec_output!()` macro.
