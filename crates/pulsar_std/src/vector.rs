//! # Vector Module
//!
//! Vector operations and utilities for the Pulsar visual programming system.
//!
//! This module provides pure vector nodes including:
//! - Vector construction (make_vector2, make_vector3, vector2_new, vector3_new)
//! - Vector deconstruction (break_vector2, break_vector3)
//! - Component access (get_vector_x, get_vector_y, get_vector_z)
//! - Component modification (set_vector_x, set_vector_y)
//! - Vector arithmetic (vector2_add, vector3_add)
//! - Vector operations (dot product, cross product, magnitude, normalize)
//!
//! ## Vector Representation
//!
//! - 2D vectors are represented as tuples: `(f32, f32)` for (x, y)
//! - 3D vectors are represented as tuples: `(f32, f32, f32)` for (x, y, z)
