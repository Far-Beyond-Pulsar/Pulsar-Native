//! # Logic Module
//!
//! Boolean logic and comparison operations for the Pulsar visual programming system.
//!
//! This module provides pure logic nodes including:
//! - Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT)
//! - Comparison operations (equals, not equals, greater than, less than, etc.)
//! - Range checking (is_between)
//! - Approximate equality (nearly_equal)
//! - Conditional selection (select_bool, select_number, select_string)
