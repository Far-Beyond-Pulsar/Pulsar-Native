//! # World Subsystem
//!
//! This module manages the game world, including loading levels, managing actors, and handling world state.
//! It utilizes the PebbleVault crate for efficient spatial storage and retrieval of game objects.
//! The World struct provides methods to add, remove, and query actors within the game world.
//! It is designed to be extensible for future features such as dynamic world generation and environmental effects.
//!
//! # Design decisions
//! - **PebbleVault Integration**: Chosen for its efficient spatial storage capabilities, allowing for quick access
//!   to game objects based on their location and for levels to be partitioned into regions by default.
//! - **Modular Structure**: The World subsystem is designed to be modular, making it easy to extend with additional
//!
//! # Features
//! - Load and manage game levels
//! - Add, remove, and query actors
//! - Spatial partitioning of the world for performance optimization
//! - Future support for dynamic world generation and environmental effects
//! - Integration with other subsystems like rendering and physics
//! - Designed for scalability to handle large game worlds
//! - Error handling and logging for robust operation
//! - Unit tests for core functionalities
