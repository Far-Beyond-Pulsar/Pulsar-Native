//! `HarvestPipeline` — single-scan per-view partition emitting global-row
//! tokens (M2b-b Wave 2 T6, design Rev 2 §5; spec §8.3-8.5, C4).
//!
//! One cell, one view, one scan: [`HarvestPipeline::harvest_cell`] queries a
//! resident cell's positional token run (via the no-allocation §8.1
//! `query_*_in` seams landed in T2) and routes every VALID token into the
//! [`MeshClass`]-selected staging array, offsetting it by the cell's GPU
//! region base. The `NULL_ROW` sentinel is dropped, never offset (§2) — a
//! `region_base + NULL_ROW` value would silently wrap into what looks like a
//! plausible-but-wrong global row, so the routing loop (and the DEI compact
//! kernel) both filter it out BEFORE the add, not after.
//!
//! DEI (§8.5): when a run's hit ratio falls below 25%, the plain
//! filter-and-offset scan is replaced by [`crate::simd::compress_tokens`] (the
//! scalar reference; AVX2 lands in T7), which additionally appends the
//! original run index of every hit to `staging.remap` — the M3-frozen
//! `remap[dense_i] = run index` layout that lets a downstream consumer map a
//! dense output slot back to its source row.
