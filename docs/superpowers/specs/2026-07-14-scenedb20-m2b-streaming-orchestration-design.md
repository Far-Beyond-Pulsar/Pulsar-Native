**Date:** 2026-07-14 (rev 2 — post adversarial review)
**Status:** M2b-α implemented (region-partitioned SceneGpuStore, asset store, phase machine); M2b-β pending (streaming grid, harvest pipeline)
**Governs:** spec §0/C0 (ownership), §5 (concentric streaming), §6/C5 (asset registry, 72 B mesh metadata, 48 B ClusterNode), §8.3–8.5/C4 (harvest, DEI), §9 (leases/scratchpads), C3 (frame phases), C6 (retirement)
**Spec of record:** `docs/superpowers/specs/SceneDB2.0.md` (Rev 2.3)
**Master design:** `specs/2026-06-09-scenedb20-implementation-design.md` §5b

## 1. Goal & position in the roadmap

M2b turns the single-cell M2a mechanism into the **engine-wide orchestration
layer**: many cells in a streaming grid, global (not per-cell) device buffers,
load-time asset upload, the harvest pipeline that will feed Helio, and the
compile-time phase machine that hard-enforces what M2a enforced by
debug-assert. Still **no Helio, no rendering**: harvest output is consumed by
tests standing in for the M3 cull pass, and all gates run headless.

### 1.1 Milestone split (binding)

M2a (one cell, two buffers) took 13 reviewed tasks; each 2b workstream is
M2a-sized, and their dependencies cut cleanly:

| Milestone | Scope | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| **M2b-α** | 2b.0 asset store (GeometryArena, MeshRegistry, ClusterBuffer, HLOD entries) + 2b.3 compile-time phase machine + global-slot mirror + SceneGpuStore reshape (regions, size-class pools) | M2a only |
| **M2b-β** | 2b.1 streaming grid/residency + 2b.2 harvest pipeline (partition, DEI, scratchpad/lease wiring) | M2b-α |

Gates: **Test 10** (lease stall/revocation, β), **Test 11** (grid boundary
oscillation, β), **Test 12** (sparse-cell DEI compaction, β), **Test 3
extension** (72 B mesh metadata + 48 B ClusterNode, α), **Test 14 extension**
(re-materialize geometry/metadata/slot-mirror buffers, α; multi-cell form, β).

## 2. The central reshape: global buffers, per-cell row spaces

Spec §10's scene SSBOs are **global**: one instance buffer, one mesh
configurator, one generation buffer for the whole scene, allocated once at
startup from configured maximums. M1/M2a give each cell an independent dense
row space `0..page.len()`. M2b reconciles them with **per-cell regions**:

- The global row-indexed buffers are partitioned into **cell regions**.
  Regions come from **size-class pools**: one pool per registered cell-type
  capacity (C2: default 256, hard max 1024), each pool a free list of
  fixed-size regions. Worst-case VRAM is exact per class:
  `Σ_class max_resident_cells(class) × capacity(class) × stride` — the §10
  "capacity set at initialization" contract, validated by the §5.3 budget
  check. `global_row = region_base + local_row`.
- M2a's `SceneBuffer<T>` gains a **region view**: `sync_region(queue, cpu,
  region_base)` — the same streaming dirty-word coalescer, offset by
  `region_base * stride`. Dirty state stays **per cell** (each resident cell
  keeps its own dirty words; the global buffer holds no global dirty mask).
  `GpuStore` (M2a, 1 store ↔ 1 cell) becomes the per-cell **CellGpuState**
  (dirty words + pending-retire queue + gen-shadow slice) owned by the new
  scene-wide **SceneGpuStore**, which owns the buffers, the region pools,
  one `SubmissionTracker`, and the generation buffer. Public API shape is
  preserved: `write_transform(cell_id, handle, m)` etc.
- **Slot spaces stay per-cell** (C1 handles are cell-scoped as in M1). The
  global generation buffer is partitioned by **slot regions** sized
  `capacity(class) + tombstone_headroom` (configurable, default 64). The
  registry invariant is `generations.len() ≤ capacity + retired_count`
  (slots do NOT grow with ordinary churn — only `u32::MAX` permanent
  retirement grows the space), so headroom only covers tombstones.
  **Slot-region exhaustion is a hard alloc error** (§8), and every
  generation write carries a region-bounds assert — an overflow must never
  land in a neighbor's region.
- **Global-slot mirror buffer (new, α):** a row-indexed `SceneBuffer<u32>`
  holding `global_slot(global_row)` — the data path for C6/§3.3 GPU handle
  validation (the M3 cull pass reads `slot = slot_mirror[row]`, then
  `generations[slot]`). Maintained at alloc and at every compaction move
  (`compact_report`'s `(from, to)` + the CPU slot-ID column 0 give the moved
  slot), dirty-tracked like transforms; Test 3 row included. The shader
  consumer is M3; the buffer and its maintenance are M2b-α so M3 does not
  reshape the store.
- Harvest emits **global-row tokens** for the M3 consumer, but the SIMD
  kernels are untouched: `query_aabb`/`query_frustum` keep writing **local**
  tokens (bit-identity across scalar/AVX2/NEON arms is preserved). The
  **single-scan partition pass** (§5.2) — which already touches every token
  once — adds `region_base` to valid tokens as it routes them; the
  `0xFFFF_FFFF` sentinel is never offset. Zero extra passes.

**Why regions, not one giant slotmap:** compaction, liveness, leases, and
pins stay cell-local (all M1/M2a machinery unchanged); promotion/demotion is
a region alloc/free instead of a scene-wide reshuffle; and worst-case VRAM
is closed-form per size class.

## 3. 2b.0 — Asset store (M2b-α, load-time path)

A second store beside the scene store, same C0 ownership, different access
pattern (write-once at load, read-forever):

- **GeometryArena** — the global vertex + index buffers with a **range
  suballocator** (first-fit free list over byte ranges; allocations are
  whole-mesh, freed only on asset unload — no per-frame churn). Upload via
  `queue.write_buffer` at load time (cold path; staging-belt optimization is
  deferred until profiled).
- **MeshRegistry** — flat host-side `Vec<MeshMetadata>` in the exact C5 72 B
  layout (`#[repr(C)]`, scalar fields only), mirrored 1:1 into the mesh
  configurator SSBO; `mesh_index` is the registry index. Host struct is
  uploaded directly — no conversion (§6). The C5 XOR rule (`lod_count` vs
  `cluster_table_offset`) is validated at registration; violation is a hard
  registration error.
- **ClusterBuffer** — global cluster-DAG buffer of C5 48 B `ClusterNode`
  entries (`self_error < parent_error` validated at registration); VG meshes
  reference it via `cluster_table_offset`.
- **HLOD proxies** are ordinary `MeshRegistry` entries indexed by a
  **cell-level handle**: a dedicated proxy cell type (one row per
  content-bearing grid cell; transform = cell placement, mesh = proxy).
  Proxy cells are a **permanently-resident size class** — spec §5.1 requires
  outer-cell proxies rendered every frame, so their regions never evict and
  the §5.3 budget counts them as an always-on term (M1 of the review). They
  ride the normal instance path; the "bypasses cluster culling" distinction
  is an M3 shader concern.
- **Material registry (32 B) stays M3** (C5: layout "defined in M3 plan").
  The buffer is allocated at configured max; its element layout, writer, and
  Test 3 row land in M3.

**Test 3 extension (α):** the naga harness (`tests/gpu_layout.rs`,
`wgsl_struct_layout`) gains `MeshMetadata` (size 72, all field offsets),
`ClusterNode` (size 48, incl. `bounding_sphere` at 32), and the slot-mirror
element — asserted explicitly against **storage** address-space layout
(Task 12 ledger note).

**Test 14 extension (α):** device loss re-materializes geometry, cluster,
metadata, and slot-mirror buffers from host-authoritative state in addition
to instance + generation. Precondition per cell (M3 of the review): every
cell's pending-retire queue is drained before rebuild — the gate drains all
cells first, mirroring `rebuild_from`'s documented guard.

## 4. 2b.1 — Streaming grid & residency (M2b-β)

- **Grid:** uniform, world-space, configured cell width; `CellCoord` → cell.
  Cells materialize lazily; each materialized cell gets a **dense cell id**
  from the residency map (stable for the cell's lifetime) which indexes the
  per-cell metadata SSBO (M4 of the review).
- **Domain classification** (frame boundary only, §5): inner = cell AABB
  intersects the **union of observer AABBs**; margin = within margin radius;
  outer = everything else. Multi-observer per §5.4. Asymmetric hysteresis per
  §5.5: promotion at `CellBounds + Δpad`, demotion at `CellBounds + Δpad +
  δhyst`, default `Δpad = 10%` of cell width (Test 11's jitter gate).
- **Budget validation** (§5.3): `StreamingBudget` computes both §5.3
  inequalities from configured radii, per-class capacities, mean proxy and
  geometry sizes, **plus a bounded world extent / max-materialized-cells
  input** (lazy grids are otherwise unbounded) and the permanent proxy-class
  term. `SceneGpuStore::new` fails hard on violation. The designer-facing
  stress-position walker tool is deferred to M4/editor.

### 4.1 Residency actions and the reset ledger (binding)

All transitions happen at the Retire/Compact boundary, never mid-frame.

**Promotion outer→margin (region acquire):**
1. Allocate a row region + slot region from the cell's size-class pool
   (hard error → cell stays outer, telemetry, §8).
2. **Generation region rebuild:** bulk-upload `registry().generations()`
   into the slot region (the M2a `rebuild` pattern at region offset) and
   **reseed the cell's gen-shadow slice from the same values**. Never assume
   zero-init: the region may be recycled from another cell (D2).
3. Reset the cell's dirty words to all-dirty for live rows (full region sync
   at the next boundary — the "streaming warm-up"), including the slot
   mirror column.
4. Cross-fade α starts rising (world-distance-driven, §5.2), mirrored into
   the per-cell metadata SSBO (`f32` α + `u32` domain, indexed by dense cell
   id).

**Promotion margin→inner:** no residency change; domain flag flips —
simulation/harvest eligibility only.

**Demotion margin→outer (eviction):**
1. The region pair is **pinned by the last submission serial that could
   reference it** and enters the region free list only after that serial
   completes (the M2a pin-by-serial pattern at region granularity — the only
   serial pinning that survives Rev 2, see §6.1).
2. **Pending-retire disposition (D2):** the region pin's serial dominates
   every serial queued in the cell's pending-retire queue, so at
   region-free-completion every queued entry is committed **CPU-side only**
   (`commit_retire`: unpin row, bump registry generation, pool slot) with
   **no VRAM write** — the cell owns no region, and writing into a freed
   (possibly re-allocated) region would corrupt a neighbor.
3. The cell's gen-shadow slice and dirty words are **dropped** (re-created
   at next promotion via the rebuild above). CPU-side cell data persists
   (host memory is authoritative); handles remain valid CPU-side in every
   domain. Staged harvest tokens need no action: they are frame-scoped (C4)
   and transitions run post-cull at the boundary (C3).

## 5. 2b.2 — Harvest pipeline (M2b-β)

Input: a view set (frusta/AABBs). Output: per-view staging arrays feeding
the (future) M3 cull pass. Zero-alloc after warm-up:

1. **Query** per resident inner cell per view (M1b SIMD kernels, unchanged,
   local tokens) into per-view scratch, under a cell read-lease against a
   **liveness snapshot captured into scratch** (see §5.1 API additions).
2. **Single-scan partition:** one pass over each cell's token run, routing
   each valid token by its mesh's registry class (traditional LOD / VG /
   HLOD-proxy) into three per-view staging arrays, **adding `region_base`
   to each valid token as it routes** (S1) — sentinels dropped here, never
   offset. Homogeneous cells take one class branch for the whole run;
   heterogeneous cells fall back to per-token metadata lookup.
3. **DEI** (§8.5, C4): per cell-run, `DEI = valid/total`; if `< 25%`, a SIMD
   masked compress-store strips sentinels into a dense payload + remap table
   (Test 12). Scalar reference first, AVX2 arm bit-for-bit after (M1b
   discipline). The **remap table is an M3-frozen interface** (M2 of the
   review): `remap[dense_i] = original_run_index` as `u32`, byte-layout
   tested in α's Test 3 harness style; its consumer (GPU cull or CPU
   re-expansion) is chosen in the M3 plan.
4. **Lease timeout** (§9.2.1): leases still held 2.0 ms into the
   frame-boundary isolation phase are revoked via M1b's `RevocationFlag`;
   the holder's results are pushed to the stale-validation lane
   (re-validated against live generations on use); compaction proceeds.
   Persistent revocation from one client = that client's bug (Test 10).

### 5.1 New API this requires (not "wiring" — S3)

- `Scratchpad::get_u32_u64(len32, len64) -> (&mut [u32], &mut [u64])` —
  split-borrow of both buffers simultaneously (the current `get_u32`/
  `get_u64` are exclusive `&mut self` borrows and cannot be held together).
- `LivenessSnapshot::capture_into(mask, len, words: &mut [u64])` — snapshot
  into caller scratch (the existing `capture` allocates its own `Vec`).
- Words-parameterized query entry points on `SpatialCell` (the kernels
  already take `&[u64]`; the public `query_aabb`/`query_frustum` today
  allocate a `Vec<u64>` internally — **both** functions, spatial.rs — this
  is the §8.1 no-alloc carry-forward, closed here).

## 6. 2b.3 — Phase machine (M2b-α, compile-time)

C3 order, as zero-size witness types consumed and produced by phase
transitions — misuse is a compile error, not a debug assert:

```text
Frame::begin() -> SimulateA -> SimulateB -> Harvest -> (Cull/Draw: M3 no-ops)
    -> Boundary { retire -> transitions -> compact -> sync } -> Frame
```

- Mutation APIs (`write_transform`, `free_deferred`, `alloc`) require
  `&SimulatePhase` witnesses; harvest APIs require `&HarvestPhase`; boundary
  ops are methods on the `BoundaryPhase` witness that consume it in order.
  M2a's runtime `Phase` enum is retained inside `SceneGpuStore` as a
  debug-assert backstop (FFI/plugin code can't be type-checked).
- **Hard-enforces the M2a carry-forwards:** raw mirrored-column writes and
  direct `cell.compact()` lose their footguns because the phase-gated store
  API is the only path exposed at the `World` level (`column_for_mut` stays
  `pub` for non-mirrored columns, with the M2a doc warnings). `free()`'s
  immediate path is demoted to `pub(crate)` at the World level: the
  phase-gated deferred path is the only public deletion on GPU-backed worlds
  (closes the release-mode double-pool hazard, Task 3 ledger).
- **Tracker caller contracts hardened (S6):** `free_deferred` debug-asserts
  nondecreasing serials per pending queue (the retire drain's FIFO
  early-break assumes it — one out-of-order enqueue would silently stall
  every retirement behind it); `signal_submitted` documents (and the phase
  driver enforces by construction) that it is called only after the work for
  that serial is submitted.

### 6.1 No harvest pins (D1 — binding rationale)

Rev 1 proposed pinning live rows for the duration of an in-flight harvest.
Traced against `cell.rs`/`store.rs` this starves compaction in steady state:
an inner cell is harvested every frame, its cull serial is incomplete at
that same frame's boundary, so every live row of every observed cell would
be pinned at every boundary and dead rows would never be reclaimed
(`rows_in_use` ratchets to capacity while `live_count` stays low). It also
made "retire wins" unreachable (`mark_pending_retire` returns `None` on any
pinned row → deferred frees would silently leak).

Row-granularity harvest pins are **unnecessary**: harvest tokens are
frame-scoped (C4); the cull consuming them is submitted during Harvest/Cull;
and the boundary's `write_buffer` syncs are queue-ordered **after** that
submission — the GPU cull of frame N always reads pre-boundary buffer
contents, so compaction moving a harvested row cannot corrupt an in-flight
cull. This queue-FIFO argument is the invariant, stated here normatively.
The **only** serial pinning in M2b is at **region granularity** (eviction,
§4.1). The pin bitmask remains single-purpose (retirement), exactly as M2a
shipped it; `mark_pending_retire`, `write_transform`, and `compact_report`
keep their M2a semantics unchanged (M2a Test 6 remains the gate).

If a future consumer genuinely reads scene buffers across a boundary
(cross-frame async compute), the mechanism is region- or buffer-level serial
pinning at that consumer's granularity — never per-row-per-frame.

## 7. Components

- `SceneGpuStore` — global buffers (instance, slot mirror, mesh
  configurator, cluster, material placeholder, per-cell metadata,
  generation), size-class region pools (rows + slots), one
  `SubmissionTracker`, per-cell `CellGpuState` map. *(α)*
- `RegionPool` — per-size-class fixed-region free list; O(1) alloc/free;
  serial-pinned free. *(α)*
- `GeometryArena` / `MeshRegistry` / `ClusterBuffer` — §3. *(α)*
- `FramePhases` — witness types + `World`-level phase driver. *(α)*
- `StreamingGrid` — coords, dense cell ids, domain classification,
  hysteresis, α cross-fade, transition queue drained at the boundary. *(β)*
- `HarvestPipeline` — per-view partition + DEI compaction over scratchpads,
  lease/snapshot handling. *(β)*
- Extended M1b types per §5.1: `Scratchpad` split-borrow,
  `LivenessSnapshot::capture_into`, words-parameterized queries. *(β)*

## 8. Error handling

- Row- or slot-region exhaustion at promotion: hard error surfaced to
  streaming telemetry; the cell stays in its current domain (degraded draw
  distance, never UB or realloc). Slot-region overflow inside a resident
  cell (tombstone headroom exhausted): hard alloc error on that cell.
- Region-bounds assert on every generation and slot-mirror write (a write
  must never land in a neighbor's region).
- Geometry arena exhaustion at load: hard error at asset registration.
- Budget violation at startup: constructor failure (§4).
- Mesh metadata XOR-rule / cluster-error-monotonicity violations: hard
  registration errors.
- Lease-pool exhaustion blocks the query (spec §9.2); revocation per §9.2.1.
- All M2a invariants (C6 ordering, pin/compact interactions) unchanged and
  re-asserted at region granularity.

## 9. Testing (headless, no Helio)

**α gates:** Test 3 extension (§3); Test 14 extension (§3, with the
all-cells-drained precondition); phase-machine compile-fail tests (trybuild
or `compile_fail` doc-tests) proving mutation outside Simulate / harvest
outside Harvest do not compile; region-pool tests (size classes, serial-
pinned free, bounds asserts); slot-mirror maintenance under alloc +
compaction moves (mutation-tested per the Task 10 precedent).

**β gates:**
- **Test 10 — lease stall:** hold a lease past the 2.0 ms isolation window
  (test-controlled clock); assert revocation fires, reads continue against
  the snapshot, results re-validate against live generations, compaction
  proceeded, and the revocation was attributed/logged.
- **Test 11 — grid oscillation:** sub-pad observer jitter across a boundary
  for N frames ⇒ zero transitions; decisive crossing ⇒ exactly one
  promotion; demotion boundary verified `δhyst` beyond promotion.
- **Test 12 — DEI compaction:** sparse cell (< 25%) ⇒ dense payload + remap
  round-trip, byte counts prove no sentinel bandwidth; ≥ 25% bypasses.
- **Residency gates:** promotion warm-up syncs the whole region including
  slot mirror and rebuilt generation region (recycled-region test: promote
  cell A, evict, promote cell B into the same region, assert B's generations
  and shadow are correct — the D2 regression test); eviction returns the
  region only after its serial completes; queued retires commit CPU-side
  with zero VRAM writes into freed regions (gen-write-count instrument, per
  the M2a shadow-gate test pattern); global-row tokens from the partition
  match region math.
- Bench additions (`scenedb_bench`): region sync throughput, harvest
  partition + DEI compaction per 1024-row cell, promotion/demotion cost —
  the M2a-deferred sync benches land here.

## 10. Deferred

- Material 32 B layout + writer + Test 3 row → **M3** (C5).
- Bindless texture array; cull/indirect/HLOD-stipple shaders; the remap
  table's consumer choice → **M3**.
- Disk/compressed outer-cell frames (§5 "compressed cell frames in host
  memory"): M2b keeps outer cells' full host data resident; the
  compress/serialize path is an M4/asset-pipeline concern.
- Streaming budget stress-walker tool (designer-facing) → **M4/editor**.
- Physics/editor client integration of the phase machine → **M4** (cutover).
