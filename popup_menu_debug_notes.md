# GPUI Popup Menu Debug Notes

## Problem Statement
Dropdown menus (popup menus) in the Pulsar Engine titlebar do not appear visually, even though the callback is triggered and prints to the console. The same menu logic works in the `menu_story.rs` example, but not in the main application.

## Debugging Steps & Findings

### 1. Event Handling
- Verified that button click events trigger the menu callback (e.g., `println!` fires).
- Event propagation and callback logic matches the working story example.

### 2. Code Porting
- Ported menu logic line-for-line from `menu_story.rs` to `hello_world/src/ui/menu.rs`.
- Used both `.popup_menu` and `.popup_menu_with_anchor` methods.
- No compilation errors; callback triggers, but menu is not rendered.

### 3. Initialization & Setup
- Confirmed that menu initialization and action setup are called as in the story example.
- No missing setup detected.

### 4. Layering & Z-Index
- Suspected layering/z-index issues might cause menu to be hidden.
- Placed test menu button outside the titlebar (in main content area) to rule out layout interference.
- Callback still triggers, but menu remains invisible.

### 5. Rendering Context
- Menu rendering may require a global overlay or special context in GPUI/gpui_component.
- Compared main app setup to story example; no obvious differences in overlay/layer management.

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Callback can trigger without visible menu; rendering context and layering are likely critical.
- Porting logic alone is insufficient; something in the main app prevents menu from rendering.

## Next Steps / Open Questions
- Investigate if GPUI or gpui_component requires a global overlay/layer for popup menus.
- Compare application initialization and root component setup with the story example.
- Check for any required global context, overlay registration, or z-index configuration.
- Consider reaching out to GPUI maintainers or searching for similar issues in upstream repositories.

## Summary
- Menu callbacks work, but menus are not visible in the main app.
- Layering, overlay, or rendering context is likely the root cause.
- Further investigation needed into GPUI/gpui_component requirements for popup menu rendering.
