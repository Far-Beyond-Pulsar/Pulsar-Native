# Markdown Viewer Test

This is a test file to demonstrate the **markdown viewer** integration in the text editor.

## Features

The markdown viewer supports:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Headers (H1-H6)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Code blocks
- Links and more!

### Code Example

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Markdown!");
}
```

### Inline Code

You can also use `inline code` like this.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

**Note**: When you open a `.md` file in the script editor, it will automatically be rendered as markdown instead of plain text.
